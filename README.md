# Memory Game
[For Peace Love and Harmony](https://sleepygallows.com/plh) themed memory game. 

## How to Play
- Click on every image once! There are 15 images that shuffle after every click.
- For every new image clicked, your score increases. If you click the same image twice, the game resets. 
- Your top score is recorded as long as you stay in the same broswer window.

## How It's Made
This memory game was made with React and Bulma UI. 

The images are being reached via the images json and mapped through.

On click, the image is givena state of isClicked true. Then its id is sent to an array and the images position is shuffled. If there is a duplicate in the array, the game ends.

When the game ends, there is a final check to see if this was your top score. There is a High score state. if your current score is higher than the stored state, then a new high score is recorded.

If you win by getting all 15 images, an alert pops up to congratulate you!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
